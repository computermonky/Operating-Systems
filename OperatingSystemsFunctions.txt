My MacOS is a great computer. It can be really useful for school and assignments. It has been a very reliable computer for me. One negative thing about it I have found is that when I am wanting to download something it is not always compatible with my mac but I seem to always find something helpful for windows that is also inexpensive.
I have used windows at work or at school. Windows seems to be the gammers choice in systems or at least far above apple. It can be a great computer choice if you are wanting to work with computers or are coding or doing all the things you can do on a computer. A downside I have found is that they seem to get viruses more often then not or have issues and then need to be revamped. I do want to get one though because I am starting to see the plus sides may outweigh the bad.
